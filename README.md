# LEGO Star Wars Texture Manager

This tool is used for extracting and/or replacing .DDS textures within LSW:TCS's .GHG files.  This also allows you to extract/replace specific textures by index.

## Installation

Download the program and run.

## Usage

This program assumes you have already extracted your .DAT files.

Exporting textures:
- Select a .GHG file from your LSW:TCS directory
- Choose the index of the texture you want to rip
- Hit the "Export..." button and choose a save location

Replacing textures:
- Create a .DDS file with the same width, height, format (DXT1, DXT5, etc.) and file size. It may be best to modify an existing texture via the export feature
- Select a .GHG file from your LSW:TCS directory
- Select your .DDS file
- Choose the index of the texture you want to replace
- Hit the "Replace" button
